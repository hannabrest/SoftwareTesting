Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for

All that I say, you always say more
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I cant give you, what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

Under hard? the skies I see ooh
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I've lived a hundred storms to leave you

As hard as you try, no I will never be knocked down
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I cant give you, what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
Turning tables

Next time I'll be braver I'll be my own savior
And if I'm the cause for me next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own savior standing on my own two feet

Chorus:
I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I cant give you, what you think you gave me

It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables, turning tables,
To turning tables, yeah turning ohh
